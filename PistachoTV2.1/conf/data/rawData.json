The area of La Carlota provides a wealth of very interesting, often flamboyant and typical characters of the Latin America upper middle and upper classes. They are among the most affected. Various vignettes in these different characters' homes are developed. These people's reactions, lifestyles, vices, and humanity come out in a very honest fashion under duress.

This program has passed through three periods. In the first period, which comes from 1979 to 1980, Caponata, the spanish name for Big Bird, lives in a street where all the neighbours are friends and live happily. Perezgil is Caponata's best friend. In the second period, from 1983 to 1987, the most succesful in Spain, Espinete is a big pink hedgehog that has a lot of friends in the street where he lives. His best friend is Don Pimpom. The third period, the most recent one, started around 1995, and I don't know the exact year when it finished. Here Blucky is the new main character and the single episode format of the two previous periods is changed by short sketches combined with Sesame Street footage. It never reached the same succes the Espinete period had and went away.","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"series","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Barney","year":1988,"rated":"N/A","released":"N/A","runtime":"5 min","genre":"Animation, Family","director":"N/A","writer":"N/A","actors":"Tim Brooke-Taylor, Harry Enfield, Jan Ravens, Enn Reitel","plot":"N/A","language":"English","typeProd":"series","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Barcelona: Juegos de sociedad","year":1992,"rated":"N/A","released":"20 Jul 1992","runtime":"25 min","genre":"Talk-Show","director":"N/A","writer":"N/A","actors":"Inka Mart�","plot":"N/A","language":"N/A","typeProd":"series","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Barrio","year":1998,"rated":"N/A","released":"02 Oct 1998","runtime":"94 min","genre":"Drama","director":"Fernando Le�n de Aranoa","writer":"Fernando Le�n de Aranoa","actors":"Cr�spulo Cabezas, Timy Benito, Eloi Yebra, Marieta Orozco","plot":"A coming-of-age story in the vein of CITY OF GOD and KIDS - available for the first time in the U.S.!","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"movie","image":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BODc3MDUxMDM4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjU2ODI0MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg"},{"_id":0,"title":"Barrios altos","year":1987,"rated":"N/A","released":"02 Oct 1987","runtime":"87 min","genre":"Comedy, Thriller","director":"Jos� Luis Garc�a Berlanga","writer":"Eduardo Calvo (story), Agust�n D�az Yanes (story), Joan Potau, Lola Salvador, Francisco G.

Merli then switches into action hero mode. In one scene he comes busting right through a wall, gun blazing, and eventually resorts to kidnapping and torture to get his revenge against the bad guys.

CQC has its own way of seeing things. \"Caiga Quien Caiga\" is a weekly news roundup that takes a humorous and ironic approach to reporting current affairs, show business and sports. A program that laughs at reality and takes information to limits beyond what is expected.

Opening with a view of Hollywood through the lens of an Asian tourist's video camera accompanied by the movie-loving tourist's ramblings, the film cuts to Jefferson City, Tennessee, where two boys indulge in fantasies of fleeing to L.A. Several years later, one of those boys, Dave, is heading west to join his childhood friend Ethan in Hollywood. Ethan has spent the past five years trying unsuccessfully to finish his untitled film, scraping together a living as an Amway salesman and construction worker. Following his arrival, Dave finds brief work on a porn set before being fired, and, as part of an attempt to help Ethan find funding for his movie, loses his virginity to a lusty Beverly Hills housewife.","language":"English","typeProd":"movie","image":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2NjQ3ODg4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDI4MDQyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg"},{"_id":0,"title":"Dr. Curry","year":1997,"rated":"N/A","released":"01 Oct 1997","runtime":"N/A","genre":"Short","director":"David Alcalde","writer":"David Alcalde, Jordi S�nchez","actors":"Pep Tosar, Oriol Roca, Jaume Balaguer�, Dar�o P�rez","plot":"N/A","language":"N/A","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Drag�n Rapide","year":1986,"rated":"N/A","released":"10 Jul 1986","runtime":"100 min","genre":"N/A","director":"Jaime Camino","writer":"Jaime Camino, Rom�n Gubern","actors":"Juan Diego, Manuel de Blas, Saturno Cerra, Eduardo MacGregor","plot":"The two weeks leading up to the Spanish Civil War in 1936 are dramatized from many different locations in Spain, Morocco and London.","language":"Spanish, Catalan, English","typeProd":"movie","image":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MDA5MTk5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDkxOTI0MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg"},{"_id":0,"title":"Drug Wars: The Camarena Story","year":1990,"rated":"PG-13","released":"07 Jan 1990","runtime":"360 min","genre":"Crime, Drama","director":"N/A","writer":"N/A","actors":"Christine Claravall, Ruben Amavizca, Ronald Fox","plot":"Fact-based story of undercover DEA agent Enrique \"Kiki\" Camarena who, while stationed in Guadalajara, uncovered a massive marijuana operation in Northern Mexico that led to his death and a remarkable investigation of corruption within the Mexican government.","language":"English","typeProd":"movie","image":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1NDE3MjM1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTg5NjkxMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg"},{"_id":0,"title":"Dret a parlar","year":1993,"rated":"N/A","released":"22 Oct 1993","runtime":"N/A","genre":"Talk-Show","director":"N/A","writer":"N/A","actors":"Miquel Piris, Cesc Sanch�s, Ramon Miravitllas, Raquel Sans","plot":"N/A","language":"Catalan","typeProd":"series","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Duelo a muerte","year":1981,"rated":"N/A","released":"04 Jan 2012","runtime":"N/A","genre":"Drama","director":"N/A","writer":"Denisse Pfeiffer","actors":"Silvia Navarro, Juan Soler, Roc�o Banquells, Ren� Casados","plot":"N/A","language":"N/A","typeProd":"episode","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Dulces coitos in Blue","year":1985,"rated":"N/A","released":"N/A","runtime":"N/A","genre":"N/A","director":"Ismael Gonz�lez","writer":"N/A","actors":"Miriam Gonz�lez, Jos� Llamas, Carlos Quiroga, Elisa Vera","plot":"N/A","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Duerme, duerme, mi amor","year":1975,"rated":"N/A","released":"N/A","runtime":"90 min","genre":"Comedy","director":"Francisco Regueiro","writer":"Esmeralda Adam Garc�a, Francisco Regueiro, Manuel Ruiz Castillo","actors":"Jos� Luis L�pez V�zquez, Mar�a Jos� Alfonso, Rafaela Aparicio, Laly Soldevila","plot":"A man who was dominated by his wife for too long sees only one chance to liberate himself: Sending his tyrannic wife to sleep with a dose.

ECO is an artificially intelligent adult simulacra who is designed with the capacity to learn and feel but is not provided with the personal history of childhood. A speculation is then presented as to how behavior is formed when every experience being internalized is a new experience, thus creating a personal history as it is realized. In this scenario, seemingly paradoxical events such as a whimsical image of a dancing circus elephant might carry with it the same emotional weight as a horribly tragic occurrence of a fatal car accident. The awareness of mourning, an emotional complex, over the absence of an intimate partner may not be fully understood but nonetheless felt. In the context of a historical absence, a context of both birth and amnesia, our own personal histories are continuously being assimilated into a discreet \"self\". During this process of historical fabrication, all events exist as a conflation of images; an aggregate collage to be parsed and interpreted as the realization of event begins to solidify emotion. Experience thus functions as inquiry into the external of one's being like sonar bouncing off of the depths of the black abyss, providing necessary analytical feedback in order to navigate difficult landscapes.","language":"English","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Edipo e Techn�","year":1997,"rated":"N/A","released":"N/A","runtime":"15 min","genre":"Short, Sci-Fi","director":"Ignacio Vilar","writer":"Chech� Carmona, Ignacio Vilar","actors":"�nxela Avalo, Isabel del Toro, Pablo Rodr�guez, Tavo Rodr�guez","plot":"N/A","language":"Gallegan","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Eduardo","year":1990,"rated":"N/A","released":"N/A","runtime":"14 min","genre":"Short","director":"Diana de Petri","writer":"N/A","actors":"Tito Augusto, Carlos Kaniowsky, Javier Rom�n, Santiago Segura","plot":"N/A","language":"N/A","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Edici�n de tarde","year":1996,"rated":"N/A","released":"29 Jan 1996","runtime":"N/A","genre":"N/A","director":"N/A","writer":"N/A","actors":"Elsa Baeza, Mar�a Teresa Campos, Mar�a Jim�nez, Paquita Torres","plot":"N/A","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"series","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"El amor es un juego extra�o","year":1983,"rated":"N/A","released":"N/A","runtime":"90 min","genre":"N/A","director":"Luis Alcoriza","writer":"Luis Alcoriza (screenplay), Luis Alcoriza (story)","actors":"Isela Vega, Humberto Zurita, Edna Bolkan, H�ctor Su�rez","plot":"N/A","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Eh?","year":1976,"rated":"N/A","released":"N/A","runtime":"9 min","genre":"Short","director":"Ignacio Amado","writer":"Ignacio Amado","actors":"N/A","plot":"N/A","language":"N/A","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Egon Schiele","year":1998,"rated":"N/A","released":"N/A","runtime":"N/A","genre":"N/A","director":"John Goldschmidt","writer":"Wolfgang G.

David, a 12-year-old orphan who lives in Europe, learns about the prophecy and believes that he is the chosen child and that destiny must be fulfilled at any cost. Before David can fulfill his prophecy he must escape the heavily guarded scientific organization that has adopted him. David's strange behavior and the fact that he possesses extrasensory perception, has attracted the attention of an organization researching so-called \"prodigious beings\" in the occult tradition. David soon discovers that their goal is to channel the moon's energy into a child yet to be born, robbing him of his rightful place as the Son of the Moon.

It's seedy and horrible, but he is suddenly transfixed when he realises that the pianist is the gifted Alberto Rossel, a close friend from before the Spanish Civil War. The film then flashes back to 1946, when Rossel has just been released from prison, having been captured at the outset by Franco's fascist forces. He is withdrawn and friendless, but his neighbours soon befriend him for his ability with the piano, and despite his classical musical interests, he manages to bang out a boogie for them to dance to. Earlier, in pre-war Paris, we see the development of the friendship between Rossel and Doria, and of romance with Teresa. We see that in those days, the young Rossel was dedicated to his music and to noble sentiments, while Doria is dedicated only to pleasure and to himself. As tension in Spain mounts, culminating in the military takeover by Franco, everyone decides to leave for Spain to fight for freedom. Everyone, that is, except Doria. Back to the present day, and at the end of the tawdry drag show, Doria finds Rossel and greets him. Does Doria understand what the intervening decades have done to their relationship?","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"El pliegue del hipocampo","year":1997,"rated":"N/A","released":"N/A","runtime":"15 min","genre":"Short, Comedy","director":"Covadonga Icaza","writer":"David Esteban Cubero","actors":"Pedro Alonso, Emilio Buale, Piluca Erasun, Ana Gilarranz","plot":"N/A","language":"N/A","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"El pico","year":1983,"rated":"N/A","released":"04 Oct 1983","runtime":"105 min","genre":"Drama","director":"Eloy de la Iglesia","writer":"Gonzalo Goicoechea, Eloy de la Iglesia","actors":"Jos� Luis Manzano, Javier Garc�a, Jos� Manuel Cervino, Luis Iriondo","plot":"N/A","language":"Spanish, Basque","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"El placer de matar","year":1988,"rated":"N/A","released":"07 Sep 1988","runtime":"90 min","genre":"Crime, Thriller","director":"F�lix Rotaeta","writer":"Angel Facio, Mario Gas, F�lix Rotaeta (novel), Domingo S�nchez","actors":"Antonio Banderas, Mathieu Carri�re, Victoria Abril, Berta Riaza","plot":"N/A","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"El pobrecito Dracul�n","year":1977,"rated":"N/A","released":"04 Sep 1977","runtime":"N/A","genre":"N/A","director":"Juan Fortuny","writer":"N/A","actors":"Joe R�goli, Josele Rom�n, V�ctor Israel, Conrado Tortosa 'Pipper'","plot":"N/A","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"El poder del deseo","year":1975,"rated":"N/A","released":"N/A","runtime":"117 min","genre":"Drama","director":"Juan Antonio Bardem","writer":"Rafael Azcona, Juan Antonio Bardem, Manuel de Pedrolo (novel)","actors":"Marisol, Murray Head, Jos� Mar�a Prada, Alfredo Alonso","plot":"N/A","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"El poder de la venganza","year":1988,"rated":"N/A","released":"N/A","runtime":"N/A","genre":"Action","director":"Germ�n Monz�","writer":"Manuel P�rez Lavid (story), Germ�n Monz� (screenplay)","actors":"Merc� Fillola, Sergio Tula, Germ�n Monz�, Juan Cassacas","plot":"N/A","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"El poderoso influjo de la luna","year":1981,"rated":"N/A","released":"21 Sep 1981","runtime":"N/A","genre":"Comedy","director":"Antonio del Real","writer":"N/A","actors":"Alfredo Landa, Adolfo Marsillach, Concha Cuetos, Mabel Esca�o","plot":"The film is an image of the Spanish society in form of various anecdotes which happen to the inhabitants and their neighbours of a finca in Madrid.","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"El poliz�n del Ulises","year":1987,"rated":"N/A","released":"N/A","runtime":"90 min","genre":"Drama","director":"Javier Aguirre","writer":"Javier Aguirre (dialogue), Ana Mar�a Matute (novel), Francisco Solanes (dialogue)","actors":"Imperio Argentina, Patxi Barko, Aurora Bautista, Eugenio Luis Berdonces","plot":"N/A","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"El precio del aborto","year":1975,"rated":"N/A","released":"N/A","runtime":"1 h 23 min","genre":"N/A","director":"Juan Xiol","writer":"Juan Xiol","actors":"Lynn Endersson, D�maso Mun�, C�sar Ojinaga, Fernando Rubio","plot":"Lynn lives with her husband Arturo on an island off the coast of Spain.

She wants to return to France immediately; he knows that they are captives and must watch every step. By chance, she meets a touring French actress and pleads for help.

Together with his friend and partner, the gruff yet gentle astronaut muscle-man Ben Grimm, Reed convinces his conceited MIT classmate Dr. Victor Von Doom, now CEO of his own enterprise, to allow him access to his privately-owned space station. Von Doom agrees in exchange for control over the experiment and a majority of the profits from whatever benefits it brings. He thus brings aboard Susan Storm, his shy, though assertive chief genetics researcher and a former lover of Reed's with whom she had an acrimonious break-up, and her diametrically opposed brother Johnny, the maverick and hot-headed playboy pilot. The astronauts make it home intact; however, before long they begin to mutate, developing strange and amazing powers as a result of their exposure to the cloud! Reed is able to stretch like rubber; Sue can turn invisible and create force fields, especially when angered; Johnny can produce fire at supernova temperatures, and is able to fly; and Ben is transformed into \"The Thing\", a large, rock-like creature with super strength. After Ben, brooding about his situation on the Brooklyn Bridge, inadvertently causes a major traffic pile-up whilst attempting to stop a man about to commit suicide, the four manage to use their powers to prevent any loss of life and to rescue a fire truck and its crew from falling off the bridge in a resulting explosion. The media dubs the team the 'Fantastic Four', and whilst Johnny eagerly embraces his powers and new life, Ben - the most heavily disfigured - particularly suffers from his transformation; his disfigurement has caused his fianc�e to abandon him and has seen him shunned and feared by much of New York. Blaming himself, Reed vows to return Ben to his human form, and he, Sue and Ben work on a cure, constructing a healing chamber in Reed's high tech Baxter Building loft-turned-laboratory. During this time, Reed and Susan begin to grow close once again, and Susan admits that she is not interested in Victor, but ended their relationship because Reed feared to commit, thinking only in terms of variables. Unknown to the others, however, Victor's body is also mutating; he is turning into organic metal capable of absorbing and manipulating electrical energy known as Doctor Doom.

Whip smart, alluring as hell, dynamic, and sexually predatory. The kind of women that own every room they walk into, and who think of all men as 'boys'. Yet, just beneath the surface, there is an insecurity and fear they cannot face. HALE BOPP is the story of just such a woman; her name is Rachel. The year is 1997. The comet Hale-Bopp is shooting across the sky for the last time in 4000 years. And in Wicker Park (Chicago's answer to Greenwich Village), Rachel is about to meet her cosmic match. Ethan, a confident young architect and seeming 'perfect guy' has invested himself, and his heart, in women like Rachel before - and he is sure he has learned his lesson. Together, Ethan and Rachel navigate the course of a relationship that is as infuriating as it is inspired, as tender as it is passionate. But for Rachel, this love stirs not only untested emotions, but forces her to confront her past. She must look beyond her history with men into a childhood that stopped short because of a shocking event that she has buried deep inside herself. If she can come to terms with it, Rachel might just have a chance at love.","language":"English","typeProd":"movie","image":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5ODM2NDEwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTE2NDg5._V1_SX300.jpg"},{"_id":0,"title":"Haika mutil","year":1997,"rated":"N/A","released":"N/A","runtime":"30 min","genre":"Short","director":"Imanol Uribe","writer":"Bernardo Atxaga","actors":"N/A","plot":"N/A","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Hamam","year":1997,"rated":"N/A","released":"02 Mar 2010","runtime":"N/A","genre":"Short","director":"Tun� Sahin","writer":"N/A","actors":"Kemal Ural, Recep Akturk, Kaan Keskin, Erol �olak","plot":"N/A","language":"Turkish","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Happy End","year":1977,"rated":"N/A","released":"24 Dec 2003","runtime":"98 min","genre":"Comedy, Romance, Drama","director":"Amos Kollek","writer":"Amos Kollek","actors":"Audrey Tautou, Justin Theroux, Jennifer Tilly, Laila Robins","plot":"Val is 23 years old and full of dreams.

Deep in the impenetrable forests of the Dark Jungle, the palace of the Maharajah of Rangnagar is raided by robbers who want to steal his legendary treasure. A battle takes place in which almost all the family and all the servants and soldiers lose their lives. There are only three survivors: Prince Tremal Naik, the Maharajah's little son, Gita, his nurse, and the bold warrior Kammamuri. Kammamuri takes it upon himself to look after the child. He takes him to live in a fisherman's hut by the river and brings him up to become a peace-loving young man who makes the mysterious world of the jungle his home. For a long time Tremal Naik, unaware of the terrible fate his family has suffered, believes Kammamuri to be his father. At the same time, in Aurangpore, Ada, the little fair-haired daughter of the British Colonel Corishant, is kidnapped, disappearing without trace. Her despairing father does not suspect that Mohan Singh, the Maharajah of Aurangpore, is at the same time the secret leader of the Thugs, a fanatical sect, and, believing little Ada to be in possession of mystical powers, is planning to bring her up to become the priestess of the sinister goddess Kali. The girl is taken to a remote valley, where Mohan Singh uses magic powers to put her into a trance and by means of black magic prepares her for her future task of serving the evil goddess. The loss of his daughter Ada almost drives Colonel Corishant mad. He instigates numerous searches but none of them is successful. Ada is nowhere to be found. Colonel Corishant has no one left to comfort him but his wife Sarah and his elder daughter Deborah. Meanwhile, in the jungle, Tremal Naik has learnt from Sonali, a girl he loves like a sister, that Kammamuri is not his real father. However, when he asks about his parents he is merely told that they are dead. Kammamuri conceals his true origins. Years pass by. Ada is still in the hands of Mohan Singh, who in his role of Maharajah, pretends to feel profound pity for the sorrowing parents. One day, when hunting, Tremal Naik comes across a secret underwater passage to the hidden valley in which the Thugs live. In this completely solitary paradise he secretly watches a blonde girl: Ada. Fascinated by Ada's grace and beauty, Tremal Naik decides he must see her again. Shortly after this, he visits his friend Father Flores, the head of a mission station in the jungle. Here he meets Sarah, Ada's mother. He is immediately struck by the likeness between Sarah and the girl in the jungle. He mentions this to Sarah and hears the story of how Ada was kidnapped ten years earlier. He returns to the valley of the Thugs and succeeds in helping Ada, who is under Mohan Singh's spell, to escape. Meanwhile Corishant, having heard Tremal Naik's story from his wife, and believing that Kammamuri and Tremal Naik are Ada's kidnappers, has Kammamuri's fisherman's hut burnt down and the old man taken prisoner. On their flight from the ruthless Thugs Tremal Naik and Ada battle their way through the pathless jungle. Ada is still under the evil influence of Mohan Singh, but the more she learns to trust Tremal Naik and feels herself protected by his love, the weaker this influence becomes. Tremal Naik's patience and sensitivity gradually help Ada to regain her memory of her origins. Ada is astonished to observe the assurance with which Tremal Naik finds his way in the jungle, his closeness to nature and his knowledge of plants and animals. In the unreal beauty of their surroundings the two young people soon grow to feel love and tenderness for each other. The lovers do not know that Kammamuri has been sentenced to death by Ada's father and that he will only be set free at the very last minute, when Sarah realizes that Kammamuri once saved her daughter's life many years before. Tremal Naik is horrified when he comes upon Kammamuri's burnt-out hut; he makes his way with Ada to Gita, his old nurse. Their arrival is observed by one of the Colonel's soldiers, and soon afterwards the Colonel and his men appear at Gita's hut. Beside himself with joy, the Colonel embraces the daughter he had believed dead. Thinking Tremal Naik to be Ada's kidnapper, he has him arrested. But Tremal Naik, with the cunning of a jungle animal, manages to escape. Mohan Singh, beside himself with rage at Ada's disappearance, also learns that she was with Tremal Naik when she was found. He assumes - rightly - that Tremal Naik has rescued Ada, and gives his Thugs orders to kill him. Tremal Naik flees to Father Flores' mission station, where he finds Kammamuri again. But the Thugs are on Tremal Naik's track and that night, in order to kill Tremal Naik and Kammamuri, they attack the mission station. A fierce battle ensues, in which Tremal Naik fights bravely. Although he succeeds in driving away his assailants, he still cannot prevent Kammamuri from being seriously wounded. Without considering the fact that he himself, a wanted man, is in great danger, Tremal Naik takes his foster-father to the Colonel's camp and asks for help. Stefan Kruger, the army medical officer, for whom Tremal Naik's childhood friend Sonali is now working as a nurse, operates on Kammamuri and saves the old man's life. Tremal Naik has been arrested and is awaiting trial. Ada has meanwhile managed to convince her sister Deborah of Tremal Naik's innocence, and Deborah asks Richard, her fianc�, to conduct Tremal Naik's defense. Richard discusses the case with Judge Forbes, and the latter asks Mohan Singh's advice. To the judge's astonishment, Mohan Singh advises him to sentence Tremal Naik to death saying that little Ada's kidnapping was, after all, a capital offence. No one suspects that it is in Mohan Singh's very own interest to get Tremal Naik out of the way. Although there is no conclusive evidence for Tremal Naik's guilt and although - in a brilliant summing-up speech - Richard proves his innocence, Tremal Naik is sentenced to ten years' hard labour on the prison island of Davenpur. No one has ever returned alive from this dreaded island. Ada is in despair. She is not even given the opportunity to take leave of her lover. When Kammamuri hears of Tremal Naik's sentence he knows what he must do. He, who after the murder of Tremal Naik's family swore never to pick up a weapon again, must now try to save the innocent young man from his fate. He arms himself and makes his way through the jungle in the direction of the prison island of Davenpur. Soon he catches sight of the group of mercenaries who are to take Tremal Naik to the island. They, however, have no intention of carrying out their task; instead they tie Tremal Naik to a tree and are about to leave him to the poisonous snakes of the jungle - and to certain death. But Kammamuri arrives on the scene at the very last minute, and before the eyes of the astonished Tremal Naik, who only knew Kammamuri as a gentle, kind man, he overpowers the mercenaries in a truly masterly and courageous fight. Just as Tremal Naik is on the point of thanking his saviour, however, the latter disappears without a trace into the darkness of the jungle. The next day in Aurangpore rumours of Tremal Naik's death are circulating. Ada is beside herself with grief. And suddenly she again feels the deadly influence of Mohan Singh, who has still not given up hope of regaining his power over Ada. In order to achieve this, he arranges a banquet to which he invites the Colonel's family. At the same time he sends out four of his Thugs to ascertain whether Tremal Naik is really dead. Tremal Naik has meanwhile appeared at the house of Stefan Kruger, the medical officer, who, together with Tremal Naik's childhood friend Sonali, is overjoyed to welcome him. But the Thugs have seen him arrive and suddenly attack from an ambush. Sonali tries to protect her friend by throwing herself in front of him, and is killed by a poisoned dagger. Tremal Naik succeeds in overpowering Sonali's murderer. Stefan Kruger calls Colonel Corishant and his men to their aid. Finally the murderer admits to having been ordered to kill Tremal Naik by Mohan Singh. Now at last Colonel Corishant realizes that Tremal Naik is innocent. But suddenly, to his horror, he remembers that Ada, her sister Deborah and their mother are at this very moment in Mohan Singh's palace. And indeed - Mohan Singh has meanwhile been doing his utmost to regain his power over Ada. While Colonel Corishant, his soldiers and Tremal Naik are trying to storm the palace, Mohan Singh puts the girl into a trance. He forces her to invoke the goddess Kali and to conjure up destruction, blood and death. During the fierce battle that follows Mohan Singh succeeds in escaping with Ada through a secret door. Deborah, seeing this happen and wanting to go after her sister, is also carried off by the Thugs. But Tremal Naik knows where the Thugs have their secret temple and rightly assumes that is where they have fled to. In the Thug's temple preparations are being made for a Black Mass, in the course of which the goddess Kali is to take possession of Ada's body. To make this possible Ada is to sacrifice her sister Deborah to the evil goddess. Just as Ada - in a deep trance - is obeying Mohan Singh's command and raising a scimitar to kill her sister, Tremal Naik, the Colonel and his soldiers break into the palace. Ada sees Tremal Naik and the spell is broken. Aroused from her trance, she flings herself into her lover's arms. A last, deadly struggle begins. Many of the Thugs are killed, wounded or taken prisoner. Only Mohan Singh, their leader, is finally able to make his escape. Deborah falls into the arms of Richard, her fianc�. Ada returns to the jungle with Tremal Naik, to the ruins of his parents' palace where, suddenly, Kammamuri appears and tells Tremal Naik the truth about who he really is. The young prince is moved and, at the same time, happy. Together with Ada he rediscovers the scenes of his childhood.","language":"English","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Hora 15","year":1977,"rated":"N/A","released":"04 Apr 1977","runtime":"30 min","genre":"News","director":"N/A","writer":"N/A","actors":"Manuel Mart�n Ferrand, Jana Escribano, Marisol Gonz�lez, Luis Miravitlles","plot":"N/A","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"series","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Hu�rfanos","year":1976,"rated":"N/A","released":"N/A","runtime":"155 min","genre":"Biography, Drama, History","director":"Guita Schyfter","writer":"Hugo Hiriart, Guita Schyfter, Fausto Zer�n-Medina","actors":"Dolores Heredia, Alan Alarc�n, Rafael S�nchez Navarro, Germ�n Jaramillo","plot":"ORPHANS is the true story of a forbidden love affair set in the oppressive and violent atmosphere of nineteenth century Mexico.

The speed with which the rhetorically gifted demagogue manages to assemble whole crowds of friends and followers around him - including above all his \"protectress\", the enigmatic Russian woman Angelika - is reflected in the speed at which he succeeds in attracting enemies from church and state. His love for the beautiful Eleonora, the daughter of a middle-class family, studying medicine at the University of Geneva - a city where Mussolini himself has been carrying stone around as an unskilled worker - even convinces him to take up studying. When a fatal accident occurs on the building-site - a worker plunges to his death from a badly-secured section of scaffolding - the young student Mussolini calls for a general strike. Arrest and expulsion are the consequences of this first piece of agitation, and it is only the intervention of his influential friend Angelika which saves him from being thrown into jail. But Mussolini is not a man to give up easily. Soon he's successful again, in Trieste, working as editor of the socialist newspaper \"L'Avventure del Lavoratore\", and a conflict soon arises between himself and the local clergy. This, however, provides the local imperial Austrian authorities with the excuse they need to expel this troublemaker and agitator from the country. Back in his native town of Forl�, Mussolini marries Rachele, his childhood sweetheart. But he's still a long way from settling down into a \"bourgeois\" lifestyle - he spends far more time with his comrades, and especially the pretty female comrades, than with Rachele and the family. It's not long before Mussolini becomes local chief of the Italian Socialist Party, in which he reveals his secure instinct for power and his talent for intrigue as he plays off various sections of the left against each other. Very soon he's levered his arch-rival Bissolati out of office: in Milan Mussolini becomes editor-in-chief of the country's largest socialist newspaper, \"Avanti!\". Mussolini exploited the escalation in violence among the country's workers for his own ends. The \"reds\" - the left-wing Socialists - and the \"yellows\" - the Republicans - were involved in a bitter war with each other. At the peak of this crisis, however, World War I broke out. While the Italian Nationalists are urging the country to take part in the war, the left wing builds its support on the pacifist strength of the \"Socialist International\": the workers of Europe must unite against the imperialist warmongers! Now that those in power represent a common enemy, Mussolini - via an adroit move - succeeds in uniting the warring left-wing factions. Although hopes that a united European left will be able to stop the war are soon dashed, Mussolini is now more powerful than ever before. It is at this period of his life that he begins to have growing doubts about neutrality and pacifism being worthy aims for a true revolutionary. Gradually he turns all his allies, even the staunchest ones, into enemies, including his beloved Angelika, by showing a lot of sympathy towards the landowning classes. The last great chapter in the history of Mussolini the socialist is now played out against the backdrop of World War I, and the transformation begins which will eventually lead him to found an entirely different type of socialism altogether - Fascismo. While the pacifists in his party are pressing for neutrality, Mussolini finally allows himself to be \"bought\" by the Conservative government. The former anti-war campaigner turned opportunist now supports the war. Now he's on his own - and at the turning-point of his political career...","language":"Italian, English","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Il richiamo del lupo","year":1975,"rated":"G","released":"01 Nov 1976","runtime":"98 min","genre":"Adventure, Western","director":"Gianfranco Baldanello","writer":"Juan Logar, Jack London (novel), Jes�s Rodr�guez","actors":"Jack Palance, Joan Collins, Fernando E.

As a young academic, teaching philosophy at Oxford, Murdoch meets and eventually falls in love with fellow professor John Bayley, a man whose awkwardness seems in stark opposition to the spirited self-confidence of his future wife. The story unfolds as snippets of time, seen through Bayley's eyes. He recalls their first encounter over 40 years ago, activities they enjoyed doing together, and Iris' charismatic and individualistic personality. These images portray Murdoch as a vibrant young woman with great intellect and are contrasted with the novelist's later life, after the effects of Alzheimer's disease have ravaged her. Murdoch's great mind deteriorates until she is reduced to a mere vestige of her former self, unable to perform simple tasks and completely reliant on her at times frustrated yet devoted husband.","language":"English","typeProd":"movie","image":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTMxMjQ3NjQ3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTc4NDEzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg"},{"_id":0,"title":"Irma y yo deseamos morir","year":1982,"rated":"N/A","released":"05 Nov 1982","runtime":"7 min","genre":"Short","director":"C�sar Solana","writer":"C�sar Solana (idea), Enrique L.

Onofre is a youngster down on his luck, abandoned by his fortune seeking father to a life of poverty and misery, alone with his mother. Once an adult, he also decides to seek fortune, and travels to Barcelona on the eve of the Universal Exposition of 1888, which so transformed the city. He immediately falls in love with Delfina, daughter of the owner of the hotel he moves into. Onofre searches for a job in this teeming city full of violence, criminals, sickness and poverty. He finds nothing. Unable to pay the hotel, he accepts a suggestion from Delfina: to produce and distribute pamphlets, during the Exposition, in support of the anarchists - a group she actively promotes, in the defense of the workers. Their relationship quickly turns into passion. But police repression dissuades him from political activity, and he returns to his original ambition of seeking fortune, at odds with Delfina's values. This transition will not only change his socio-economic standing, but will represent a political break which may turn Delfina away from him.","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"movie","image":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0NTY2OTMwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzc0MzMzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg"},{"_id":0,"title":"La ciudad maldita","year":1978,"rated":"N/A","released":"29 Nov 1978","runtime":"91 min","genre":"Thriller, Western","director":"Juan Bosch","writer":"Juan Bosch, Alberto De Stefanis, Dashiell Hammett (novel)","actors":"Chet Bakon, Diana Lorys, Roberto Camardiel, Daniel Mart�n","plot":"N/A","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"La ciutat sense ponts","year":1992,"rated":"N/A","released":"N/A","runtime":"16 min","genre":"Short","director":"Manuel Polls Pelaz","writer":"Manuel Polls Pelaz","actors":"Pepa Aren�s, Philippe Desnier, Giles Duffaut, Merc� Espelleta","plot":"N/A","language":"N/A","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"La claror daurada","year":1989,"rated":"N/A","released":"N/A","runtime":"N/A","genre":"Comedy, Drama","director":"N/A","writer":"N/A","actors":"Josep Maria Angelat, Merc� Bruquetas, Montserrat Carulla, Paquita Ferr�ndiz","plot":"N/A","language":"Catalan","typeProd":"series","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"La clave","year":1990,"rated":"N/A","released":"18 Jan 1976","runtime":"180 min","genre":"Talk-Show","director":"N/A","writer":"N/A","actors":"Jos� Luis Balb�n","plot":"N/A","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"series","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"La comedia dram�tica espa�ola","year":1986,"rated":"N/A","released":"01 Jul 1986","runtime":"90 min","genre":"Comedy, Drama","director":"N/A","writer":"N/A","actors":"Ismael Abell�n, H�ctor Alterio, Luisa Armenteros, Miguel Ayones","plot":"N/A","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"series","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"La clave","year":1976,"rated":"N/A","released":"18 Jan 1976","runtime":"180 min","genre":"Talk-Show","director":"N/A","writer":"N/A","actors":"Jos� Luis Balb�n","plot":"N/A","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"series","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"La comedia","year":1983,"rated":"N/A","released":"23 Jul 2006","runtime":"25 min","genre":"N/A","director":"N/A","writer":"N/A","actors":"Miki L�pez, Vanesa Maestre","plot":"N/A","language":"N/A","typeProd":"episode","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"La cometa blanca","year":1981,"rated":"N/A","released":"21 Oct 1981","runtime":"45 min","genre":"Family","director":"N/A","writer":"N/A","actors":"Herta Frankel, Jaime Blanch, Maite Tojar, Rosa Le�n","plot":"N/A","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"series","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"La comida","year":1997,"rated":"N/A","released":"02 Aug 2012","runtime":"N/A","genre":"Comedy","director":"N/A","writer":"N/A","actors":"Pau Garcia-Mil�, Andreu Buenafuente","plot":"N/A","language":"N/A","typeProd":"episode","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"La cocina de Argui�ano","year":1995,"rated":"N/A","released":"17 Sep 1995","runtime":"25 min","genre":"N/A","director":"N/A","writer":"N/A","actors":"Karlos Argui�ano","plot":"Basque cook and showman Karlos Argui�ano hosts the most famous cooking show in Spain.","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"series","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"La compania","year":1997,"rated":"N/A","released":"N/A","runtime":"N/A","genre":"Short","director":"Jos� Luis Rodr�guez","writer":"N/A","actors":"N/A","plot":"N/A","language":"N/A","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"La cocina en casa","year":1990,"rated":"N/A","released":"N/A","runtime":"22 min","genre":"Short","director":"Pablo Llorca","writer":"Pablo Llorca","actors":"Manolo Calder�n, Mar�a Molina Temboury, Paloma Molina Temboury, Marcos Velasco","plot":"N/A","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"La comedia musical espa�ola","year":1985,"rated":"N/A","released":"01 Oct 1985","runtime":"120 min","genre":"Comedy, Musical","director":"N/A","writer":"N/A","actors":"�ngel de Andr�s, Mar�a Barranco, Fernando Santos, Tom�s Zori","plot":"N/A","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"series","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"La colmena","year":1982,"rated":"N/A","released":"03 Oct 1985","runtime":"105 min","genre":"Drama","director":"Mario Camus","writer":"Camilo Jos� Cela (novel), Jos� Luis Dibildos","actors":"Victoria Abril, Ana Bel�n, Concha Velasco, Francisco Rabal","plot":"As in the novel of the same title from Camilo Jose Cela, \"La Colmena\" is a sad composition with the stories of many people in the Madrid of 1942, just the postwar of the spanish civil war.

In each program, one of King Falop's (Anthony Quinn) daughters was kidnapped by a bad wizard and taken to a castle. He asked three couples to go to the quest of getting the princess back. Each program was divided in three stages. In the first stage, the three couples had to go through a car race, with many different obstacles they had to pass as fast as they could. They had to go through a road which had differente bifurcations, each one leading to an obstacle. They had to choose one way, and with luck they could find the easy obstacle. Some obstacles were dificult, others made the couple loose time, and so on. They would be guided by radio by the host and his assistant (Marta de Pablo). Only the winning couple, the one who reached the castle in the first place, would go on to the second stage. In this stage, the couple went through a short of \"role playing\", in a style very similar to the \"Knightmare\" program, but with real backgrounds, inside the castle (all the castles in the series were real, in different parts of Spain). They had to talk to the inhabitants in the castle, get objects if they had to, and solve puzzles, in order to get to the dungeon where the princess was hidden. They would be guided in every moment by the host of the program (Luis Fernando Albes) They only had one hour to reach her, because if they didn't manage to find her, she would be killed and the game would be over. During the quest, there was an important rule: they could never be touched by the wizard that kidnapped the princess (I forgot his name, sorry) or the quest would be over, so when the wizard appeared, they had to run away as fast as they could.

Awaiting her backstage one evening is a Spanish painter who has seen her show and wants to make her acquaintance. They walk around Paris getting to know one another, and then the painter returns to Spain. Something about the man has moved Lady M to passion: she flies to meet him in Barcelona and he shows her his beloved Catalonia. This time, however, their relationship is as much about passionate lovemaking as it is about compatibility.

La guerra cambi� su vida, el amor cambi� su destino. Carlos Fuentes encabeza el reparto de Mambi. Es Goyo, un joven jornalero canario al que obligan a alistarse en el ej�rcito para luchar contra los mambises, guerrilleros independentistas, levantados en armas contra Espa�a. Goyo es uno de los miles de j�venes de baja extracci�n social que, a finales de siglo, fueron reclutados a la fuerza y condenados a pelear hasta la muerte en una isla tan lejana como bella. La historia de Goyo es la de un desertor, pero podr�a ser la de cualquiera de los isle�os - como se conoce a los emigrantes canarios - que durante el siglo XIX convirtieron a Cuba en el destino preferido de su di�spora. Muchos de estos isle�os acabar�an integr�ndose con la poblaci�n criolla, fomentando un nuevo mestizaje y defendiendo los intereses de Cuba frente a la colonia. A trav�s de los protagonistas de uno y otro bando, Mambi la doble cara de un espejo con intereses irreconciliables: Espa�a, en el ocaso de su imperio; Cuba, en el inicio de su independencia, y Estados Unidos, el pa�s que, a la postre, sacar�a m�s beneficio de un conflicto que espole� y que le era ajeno. La pel�cula de Teodoro y Santiago R�os no es solo una recreaci�n hist�rica. Aunque la avala una cuidada ambientaci�n, Mambi es, en palabras de sus directores, una pel�cula de antih�roes vapuleados por las situaciones y los acontecimientos; una historia de amor y aventuras y una reflexi�n sobre el destino del hombre en �pocas de crisis, precisamente cuando se ponen a prueba los valores humanos.","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Mamasunci�n","year":1985,"rated":"N/A","released":"01 May 1985","runtime":"N/A","genre":"Short, Drama","director":"Chano Pi�eiro","writer":"Chano Pi�eiro","actors":"Ant�n Casal, T�a Sunci�n, Manuel Barreiro, David de Li�ares","plot":"N/A","language":"Gallegan","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Mam�, pap�... y la novia de pap�","year":1995,"rated":"N/A","released":"N/A","runtime":"N/A","genre":"N/A","director":"N/A","writer":"N/A","actors":"Maribel Verd�, Silvia Mars�, Luis Merlo, Ana Risue�o","plot":"N/A","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"episode","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Mamma m�a","year":1999,"rated":"N/A","released":"04 Apr 1999","runtime":"30 min","genre":"Comedy","director":"N/A","writer":"N/A","actors":"V�ctor Sandoval, Francine G�lvez, Pilar Soto, Patricia P�rez","plot":"N/A","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"series","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Mando a distancia","year":1989,"rated":"N/A","released":"N/A","runtime":"N/A","genre":"N/A","director":"N/A","writer":"N/A","actors":"Ar�valo, Jos� Mota, Juan Mu�oz, Los Ronaldos","plot":"N/A","language":"Gallegan","typeProd":"series","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Ma�anas de primera","year":1996,"rated":"N/A","released":"09 Sep 1996","runtime":"180 min","genre":"N/A","director":"N/A","writer":"N/A","actors":"Laura Valenzuela, Tate Montoya, Lara Dibildos, Teresa Viejo","plot":"N/A","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"series","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Mar a mar","year":1991,"rated":"N/A","released":"N/A","runtime":"N/A","genre":"Music","director":"N/A","writer":"N/A","actors":"Nuria G�mez, Beatriz Manj�n","plot":"N/A","language":"Gallegan","typeProd":"series","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Manolito Gafotas","year":1999,"rated":"N/A","released":"04 Jan 2004","runtime":"60 min","genre":"Comedy","director":"N/A","writer":"N/A","actors":"Adriana Ozores, Christopher Torres, Antonio Gamero, Manuel Manqui�a","plot":"N/A","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"series","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Mar brava","year":1983,"rated":"N/A","released":"16 Aug 1983","runtime":"92 min","genre":"Drama, Fantasy","director":"Angelino Fons","writer":"Juan Antonio Porto (story), Luis Murillo (screenplay), Angelino Fons (screenplay)","actors":"Alfredo Mayo, Jorge Sanz, Alma Muriel, Guillermo Ant�n","plot":"Mingo, a kid whose father and brother have disappeared in shipwrecks, finds an amnesic man lying on the beach.

That man was Charles Calvin, the head of Unidyne, a humanitarian organization that works toward world peace. David notices other unusual goings-on. What he considers his normal routine that others he knows should recognize, don't. People that he doesn't know seem to know him, such as the beautiful young woman with who he walked down the stairs but who ran off when they got to the bottom. And things that he thought he saw or thought he knew end up not being the case, such as the multiple sub-basement levels he thought were in that office building which don't seem to exist in the clear light of day. When he finally thinks about it, he believes he has some form of amnesia. As an example, he knows that he works as a cost accountant, but he has no idea what a cost accountant is or does. He soon learns that some people are following him and are after something that he has, he not knowing what it is, and that they will shoot to kill if they don't get it. Conversely, the young woman, who he learns is named Shela and was once a love of his, is trying to convince him to cooperate with the people after him if only to save his life. Every direction David turns for official assistance, he comes up not trusting anyone, with the exception of a novice private detective he hires named Ted Caselle. Shela and the people after David all refer to \"the major\" as the person at the top who wants what David has. David may have to look deep into his troubled psyche to come out of his amnesia to learn who the major is, what he wants, whether David is willing to give it up if he indeed does have it, and that the death of Charles Calvin had some part to play. But David may be dead before he can even make an informed decision to cooperate or not.","language":"English","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Miralls","year":1999,"rated":"N/A","released":"N/A","runtime":"N/A","genre":"N/A","director":"N/A","writer":"N/A","actors":"Eduard Farelo, Rosa Novell, Marina Rossell, Isabel-Clara Sim�","plot":"N/A","language":"N/A","typeProd":"series","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Miramar","year":1977,"rated":"N/A","released":"01 Sep 1997","runtime":"82 min","genre":"Drama","director":"J�lio Bressane","writer":"Oswald de Andrade (novel), J�lio Bressane","actors":"Jo�o Rebello, Giulia Gam, Diogo Vilela, Louise Cardoso","plot":"Story with some autobiographical touches taken from director's life.

exchange that goes awry, causing the lives of nine unsuspecting characters to explode in one tumultuous night over a fortune in diamonds. Diego Luna stars as computer hacker Lolo, who is infatuated with his neighbor Andrea and catalogs her every move via high-tech peeping devices. Lolo teams with amateur criminals Tomson and his younger counterpart Nene in a deal with a Russian mobster that involves the exchange of diamonds for computer access to Swiss bank accounts. But the deal goes terribly wrong after Lolo's attempts to spoil Andrea's romantic trysts spiral out of control. Down the street, the irritable pharmacist Beto and his fed-up wife Clara get inadvertently entangled in the exchange, along with the humble barber Goyo and his domineering other half Carmen. Infected with diamond lust, these characters become obsessed with the intoxicating possibility of an easy life and their greed quickly transforms into fiery desperation. When the haze finally clears, computers have been hacked, people have been whacked and lives have gone up in a cloud of smoke.","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"movie","image":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5MzQyODkwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc3NzYyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg"},{"_id":0,"title":"N�meros rojos","year":1994,"rated":"N/A","released":"04 Nov 1994","runtime":"N/A","genre":"N/A","director":"Jos� Miguel Ganga","writer":"Jorge Barriuso, Miguel �ngel Fern�ndez, Juan Flahn, Jos� Miguel Ganga (idea)","actors":"Maribel Verd�, Silvia Mars�, Luis Merlo, Ana Risue�o","plot":"N/A","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"episode","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Ni�as... al sal�n","year":1977,"rated":"N/A","released":"N/A","runtime":"N/A","genre":"N/A","director":"Vicente Escriv�","writer":"Fernando Vizca�no Casas","actors":"Dagmar Lassander, Josele Rom�n, Antonio Casas, Rafael Hern�ndez","plot":"N/A","language":"N/A","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Ninette y un se�or de Murcia","year":1984,"rated":"N/A","released":"04 Nov 1965","runtime":"105 min","genre":"Comedy","director":"Fernando Fern�n G�mez","writer":"Fernando Fern�n G�mez, Miguel Mihura (play), Jos� Mar�a Otero","actors":"Rosenda Monteros, Fernando Fern�n G�mez, Alfredo Landa, Aurora Redondo","plot":"N/A","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Ni�o nadie","year":1997,"rated":"N/A","released":"04 Apr 1997","runtime":"100 min","genre":"N/A","director":"Jos� Luis Borau","writer":"Jos� Luis Borau","actors":"Rafael �lvarez 'El Brujo', Ic�ar Bolla�n, Pedro Alonso, Adriana Ozores","plot":"N/A","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Ni�os fr�os","year":1989,"rated":"N/A","released":"N/A","runtime":"N/A","genre":"N/A","director":"Carmelo Espinosa","writer":"Carmelo Espinosa","actors":"N/A","plot":"N/A","language":"N/A","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Nissaga de poder","year":1996,"rated":"N/A","released":"28 Jan 1996","runtime":"25 min","genre":"Crime, Drama","director":"N/A","writer":"N/A","actors":"Emma Vilarasau, Jordi Dauder, Eduard Farelo, Jordi Bosch","plot":"N/A","language":"Catalan","typeProd":"series","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Nit d'arts","year":1998,"rated":"N/A","released":"27 Nov 1998","runtime":"N/A","genre":"Music","director":"N/A","writer":"Marcel Gorgori","actors":"Marcel Gorgori","plot":"N/A","language":"Catalan","typeProd":"series","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Nissaga l'her�ncia","year":1999,"rated":"N/A","released":"12 May 1999","runtime":"50 min","genre":"Crime, Drama","director":"N/A","writer":"N/A","actors":"Marc Rodr�guez, �ngels S�nchez","plot":"N/A","language":"Catalan","typeProd":"series","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Nit en blanc","year":1999,"rated":"N/A","released":"20 Oct 1999","runtime":"N/A","genre":"Talk-Show","director":"N/A","writer":"N/A","actors":"Guillermina Motta","plot":"N/A","language":"Catalan","typeProd":"series","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"No et tallis ni un p�l","year":1992,"rated":"N/A","released":"N/A","runtime":"1 h 32 min","genre":"N/A","director":"Francesc Casanova","writer":"Francesc Casanova","actors":"Ramon Madaula, Merc� Lleix�, David Bag�s, Raquel Crusat","plot":"N/A","language":"N/A","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"No llevamos dinero","year":1986,"rated":"N/A","released":"N/A","runtime":"6 min","genre":"Short","director":"Mariano Barroso","writer":"Mariano Barroso (script)","actors":"Vicente D�ez, Juan Carlos Hidalgo","plot":"N/A","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"No hagas planes con Marga","year":1988,"rated":"N/A","released":"10 Oct 1988","runtime":"91 min","genre":"Drama","director":"Rafael Alc�zar","writer":"Rafael Alc�zar","actors":"Miguel Molina, Nina Ferrer, �ngel de Andr�s L�pez, Juan Echanove","plot":"N/A","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"No me compliques la vida","year":1991,"rated":"N/A","released":"N/A","runtime":"88 min","genre":"Romance","director":"Ernesto Del R�o","writer":"Ernesto Del R�o, Luis Eguiraun, Santiago Gonz�lez","actors":"Jorge de Juan, Mabel Ord��ez, Jes�s Bonilla, Ram�n Barea","plot":"N/A","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"movie","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"No matar�s","year":1975,"rated":"Approved","released":"08 Nov 1935","runtime":"92 min","genre":"Crime, Drama, Romance","director":"Miguel Contreras Torres","writer":"Miguel Contreras Torres (story)","actors":"Ram�n Pereda, Adriana Lamar, Alberto O'Farril, Estela Segarra","plot":"Antonio Guerra is an unemployed Spanish immigrant in the USA.

But in a swimming pool accident they collide, and, nearly dying they recover, but they have exchanged bodies! They are horrified to discover that they are in the wrong bodies, and getting together, they agree that the only way to survive is to co-operate and try to deceive the world into thinking that nothing has happened. But Belinda (in Juan's body) knows nothing about football, and the players just laugh. Juan (in Belinda's body) tries to give tips over a mobile phone. She also visits her fiance about the wedding, but of course the fiance only sees a male body, and there is a surprising moment. Belinda increasingly has second thoughts about the wedding. Juan's musical efforts are equally unsuccessful, but brought together in the stress of trying to survive the situation, Juan and Belinda find themselves increasingly attracted to one another ... and at least between themselves they don't have to pretend to be what they are not.","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"movie","image":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzMTUxNjQ3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQwNDMzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg"},{"_id":0,"title":"Pop que","year":1984,"rated":"N/A","released":"23 Jul 1984","runtime":"50 min","genre":"Musical","director":"N/A","writer":"N/A","actors":"Carlos Tena, Jos� Mar�a Tasso","plot":"N/A","language":"Spanish","typeProd":"series","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"Poppers","year":1984,"rated":"N/A","released":"15 Oct 1984","runtime":"83 min","genre":"N/A","director":"Jos� Mar�a Castellv�","writer":"Jos� Mar�a Castellv� (screenplay), Jacinto Santos (screenplay), Jos� Mar�a Castellv� (dialogue), Luis Infante (dialogues)","actors":"Giannina Facio, Agust�n Gonz�lez, Conrado San Mart�n, Alfredo Mayo","plot":"A man called Santos leaves the jail.

And what if besides this, Quim, an ex-lover of Rosita�s who in a matter of 24 hours has lost his job, his home, his clothes, his memory and a mysterious suitcase full of money, should bump into the diva at Sofia airport, and she were to take advantage of her young friend's amnesia to seduce him?

And if Tina's best friend, Manoli, a tourist guide with a severe complex resulting from her childhood traumas, should end up dating Frank?

THE VIRGIN AND THE BULL: Best-selling Mexican author Fuentes looks for his forebears in the mix of people that created Latin America: Spanish, Arab, Jewish, Indian, and African. He asks what is unique in their culture that is cause for celebration in the 500th anniversary year of Columbus. His quest takes him from the quayside at Vera Cruz \"where the Mediterranean comes to an end in the Caribbean\" back to the dark caves of Altamirea, the harsh sunlight of the bullring, and the stamping feet of the flamenco dancer. CONFLICT OF THE GODS: In his lifetime, Fuentes has witnessed the rediscovery of the ancient Aztec temples beneath the central square of modern Mexico City. \"So we found out that what we thought was dead was really alive.\" He retraces the Indian world through their magnificent pyramids and sculptures, a world of precise astronomy and human sacrifice, serenity and violence. The return of their blond, exiled god was forecast for the very year Cortes reached their shores. THE AGE OF GOLD: The New World bought Spain (and ultimately Europe) enormous treasures: gold, silver, chocolate, tomatoes, potatoes. Yet Spain's most powerful ruler, Philip II, lived in austere solitude in a cell-like study. He sought to protect the Catholic faith, while the Spanish author Cervantes questioned all values in Don Quixote, the prototype of the modern novel. Courtly painters and Baroque style vaulted the Atlantic and celebrated its transformation into a tool for Indian fantasy in the magnificent churches of Potosi and Ocotlan. THE PRICE OF FREEDOM: Every year, a million Mexicans gather in the great central square of their capital to celebrate El Grito, the cry for Independence. Fuentes crosses the Andes in the steps of Bolivar and San Martin. The liberators succeeded n throwing off the Spanish yoke, but they found it harder to establish a just society. For the gaucho there was the consolation of the open spaces, the mountains, and the plains. And for those crowding into the new cities like Buenos Aires, there was the tango, a sad thought that can be danced. UNFINISHED BUSINESS: Spain, Latin America, the Hispanic communities in the U. S.: all have undergone enormous changes in this century. Within the lifetime of those born now, half the population of the U.S. will be Spanish speaking. Every year, half a million brave the border patrols to enter the States illegally. \"They are looking for the Gringo gold, but also bringing the Latino gold,\" Carlos Fuentes observes. Hispanic immigrants contribute a wealth of tradition: diverse cultural creativity in art, music, and dace, respect for family ties--distinct hallmarks of the Spanish-speaking world","language":"N/A","typeProd":"movie","image":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BNDk4MDg0MjQ3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDM5NDkyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg"},{"_id":0,"title":"The Cobi Troupe","year":1992,"rated":"N/A","released":"N/A","runtime":"N/A","genre":"Animation","director":"N/A","writer":"N/A","actors":"N/A","plot":"The adventures of Cobi, a Barcelona Olympics mascot.","language":"N/A","typeProd":"series","image":"N/A"},{"_id":0,"title":"The End","year":1996,"rated":"TV-14","released":"23 May 2010","runtime":"105 min","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy","director":"Jack Bender","writer":"Jeffrey Lieber (created by), J.J.

That fierce loyalty leads to Doug challenging a group of bar patrons to a back alley fight on Lily, Robin, Ted, Marshall and Barney's behalf, but with the implication that Ted, Barney and Marshall join him in the brawl. After thinking about it, Ted, who has never been in a bona fide fist fight, believes a fight is something he needs to do once in his life and agrees to join Doug. Barney also goes to fight once he finds out that Robin, the hockey fan, is into brawlers. Marshall, on the other hand, won't fight, stating that he's been in many a fight before with his brothers and doesn't need to prove anything. When Ted and Barney come back from the fight with black eyes but are still standing while their opponents are out cold, they are seen as heroes by the other bar patrons, except for Marshall. Ted and Barney, basking in their new glory and with Doug vowing to provide them free drinks for life, have to make a confession about the fight when it has an unexpected consequence.
